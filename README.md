Student Directory
=================

A simple program to deal with the members of the varous Makers Academy cohorts. It will allow the to manually input members, as well as loading from and saving to .csv files.

Day one/two
-----------
Worked with Eddie. Created simple methods to input and display students. Ran through a series of exercises to modify the code to perform specific tasks, such as displaying students from a particular cohort. Added an interactive menu, and methods to save to and load from a file. Worked with command line arguments.

Day three
---------
Worked with Zoe. Started student-directory from scratch (directory3.rb), writing the whole thing without referring to the original tasks, using different methods to make it more efficient and better organised. Added greater control of files.

How to use
----------

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
